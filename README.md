# NCForward
## Description
NCForward lets you forward your iOS notifications to ANY other device in your local network (LAN/WLAN). Currently, Windows is supported, Mac and Linux are not.
You will need to have a Client and a server of your choice (not yet :P) running in the same local network.

## License
Do what you want with it, just email me if you are going to publish parts of this.
I also would like to be mentioned in the source code, if published in source code form,
and credited, if published only in binary form.
Due to the informality of this license, you are allowed to ignore this if you really want to.
